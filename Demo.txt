The JavaScript language
Here we learn JavaScript, starting from scratch and go on to advanced concepts like OOP.

We concentrate on the language itself here, with the minimum of environment-specific notes.

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.

In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.

Thank You
